/// Extensions on [Color] to brighten, lighten, darken and blend colors and
/// can get a shade for gradients.
///
/// Some of the extensions are rewrites of TinyColor's functions
/// https://pub.dev/packages/tinycolor. The TinyColor algorithms have also
/// been modified to use Flutter's HSLColor class instead of the custom one in
/// the TinyColor lib. The functions from TinyColor re-implemented as Color
/// extensions here are [brighten], [lighten] and [darken]. They are used
/// for color calculations in FlexColorScheme, but also exposed for reuse.
///
/// Another frequently used extension is [blend] and [blendAlpha] used to blend
/// two colors using alpha as a percentage or as an 8-bit int alpha value.
/// This extension is used to calculate branded surface
/// colors used by FlexColorScheme's branded surfaces and for automatic dark
/// color schemes from a light scheme.
///
/// The [getShadeColor] extension is less frequently used and when used,
/// typically used to color makes colors shades for gradient AppBars, with
/// default setting to not change black and white.
///
/// The color extension also include getting a color's RGB hex code as a string
/// in two different formats. Extension [hexCode] returns a Flutter style
/// HEX code string of a Color value, meaning it starts with 0x and alpha value
/// before the RGB Hex values. The plain [hex] extension returns a typical
/// API formatted hex color string starting with # and no alpha value.
